NVIDIA RTL License Agreement ((v. May 16, 2023)

IMPORTANT NOTICE - PLEASE READ AND AGREE BEFORE USING THE RTL.

This license agreement ("Agreement") is a legal agreement between you, whether an individual or entity ("you") 
and NVIDIA Corporation ("NVIDIA") and governs the use of the NVIDIA Interface Circuitry RTL that is provided in 
encrypted form  ("RTL"). 

This Agreement can be accepted only by an adult of legal age of majority in the country in which the RTL is used. 
If you don't have the required age or authority to accept this Agreement, or if you don't accept all the terms and 
conditions of this Agreement, do not use the RTL. 

You agree to use the RTL only for purposes that are permitted by this Agreement and any applicable law or 
regulation in the relevant jurisdictions. 

1.	License Grant. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, NVIDIA grants you a non-exclusive, revocable, non-
transferable, non-sublicensable (except as expressly granted in this Agreement), license to:

1.1	install and use copies of the RTL with Approved FPGA Vendors tools to integrate into user FPGA designs.  
Approved FPGA Vendors are those who have developed build tools that use the RTL and have obtained a license 
from NVIDIA to enable their build tools to decrypt the RTL.

2.	Limitations. Your license to use the RTL is restricted as follows:

2.1	The RTL is licensed for you to integrate into your user FPGA design only for use in systems with NVIDIA 
GPUs, CPUs and DPUs.

2.2	You may not change or remove copyright or other proprietary notices in the RTL.

2.3	Except as expressly granted in this Agreement, you may not copy, sell, rent, sublicense, transfer, 
distribute, modify or create derivative works of the RTL, or make its functionality available to others. 

2.4	You may not bypass, disable or circumvent any technical limitation, encryption, security, digital rights 
management or authentication mechanism in the RTL.

2.5	You may not use the RTL in any manner that would cause it to become subject to an open source license.

2.6	You may not use the RTL for the purpose of developing competing products or technologies or assist a 
third party in such activities. 

2.7	You may not indicate that a product or service developed with the RTL is sponsored or endorsed by 
NVIDIA.

2.8	You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble any portion of the output generated using RTL 
elements for the purpose of translating such output artifacts to target a non-NVIDIA platform.

2.9	You acknowledge that the RTL provided under this Agreement is not designed or tested by NVIDIA for use 
in any system or application where the use or failure of such system or application developed with NVIDIA's RTL 
could result in injury, death or catastrophic damage (each, a "Mission Critical Application"). Examples of Mission 
Critical Applications include use in avionics, navigation, autonomous vehicle applications, AI solutions for 
automotive products, military, medical, life support or other mission-critical or life-critical applications. NVIDIA 
will not be liable to you or any third party, in whole or in part, for any claims or damages arising from these uses. 
You are solely responsible for ensuring that systems and applications developed with the RTL include sufficient 
safety and redundancy features and comply with all applicable legal and regulatory standards and requirements.

2.10	You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless NVIDIA and its affiliates, and their respective 
employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors, from and against any and all claims, damages, 
obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, fines, restitutions and expenses (including but not limited to 
attorney's fees and costs incident to establishing the right of indemnification) arising out of or related to (i) 
products or services that have been developed or deployed with or use the RTL, or claims that they violate laws, 
or infringe, violate, or misappropriate any third party right; or (ii) a violation of the terms and conditions of this 
Agreement. 

3.	Authorized Users. You may allow employees and contractors of your entity or of your subsidiary(ies) to 
access and use the RTL from your secure network to perform the work authorized by this Agreement on your 
behalf. If you are an academic institution, you may allow users enrolled or employed by the academic institution 
to access and use the RTL as authorized by this Agreement from your secure network. You are responsible for 
the compliance with the terms of this Agreement by your authorized users. Any act or omission that if 
committed by you would constitute a breach of this Agreement will be deemed to constitute a breach of this 
Agreement if committed by your authorized users.

4.	Confidentiality. You agree that you will not use, nor authorize others to use, NVIDIA Confidential 
Information, except as necessary for the performance of this Agreement, and that you will not disclose NVIDIA 
Confidential Information to any third party, except to permitted users under this Agreement that have a need to 
know such Confidential Information for the purpose of this Agreement, provided that each such recipient is 
subject to a written agreement that includes confidentiality obligations consistent with these terms. You will 
protect the NVIDIA Confidential Information with at least the same degree of care that you use to protect your 
own similar confidential and proprietary information, but no less than a reasonable degree of care. "Confidential 
Information" means the RTL including its features and functionality, output, and any results of benchmarking or 
other competitive analysis or regression or performance data relating to the RTL. 

5.	Updates. NVIDIA may, at its option, make available patches or other updates to the RTL. Unless the updates 
are provided with their separate governing terms, they are deemed part of the RTL licensed to you as provided 
in this Agreement.

6.	Termination. This Agreement will automatically terminate without notice from NVIDIA if you fail to comply 
with any of the terms in this Agreement or if you commence or participate in any legal proceeding against 
NVIDIA with respect to the RTL. Additionally, NVIDIA may terminate this Agreement with prior written notice to 
you if, in NVIDIA's sole discretion, the continued use of the RTL is no longer commercially viable or creates 
liabilities for NVIDIA. You agree to cooperate with NVIDIA and provide reasonably requested information to 
verify your compliance with this Agreement. Upon any termination, you must stop using and destroy all copies 
of the RTL. Upon written request, you will certify in writing that you have complied with your commitments 
under this section. All provisions will survive termination, except for the licenses granted to you.

7.	Ownership.  

7.1	NVIDIA Ownership. The RTL, including all intellectual property rights, is and will remain the sole and 
exclusive property of NVIDIA or its licensors. Except as expressly granted in this Agreement, (i) NVIDIA reserves 
all rights, interests and remedies in connection with the RTL and (ii) no other license or right is granted to you by 
implication, estoppel or otherwise.

8.	Feedback. You may, but are not obligated to, provide suggestions, requests, fixes, modifications, 
enhancements or other feedback regarding or in connection with your use of the RTL (collectively, "Feedback"). 
Feedback, even if designated as confidential by you, will not create any confidentiality obligation for NVIDIA or 
its affiliates. If you provide Feedback, you hereby grant NVIDIA, its affiliates and its designees a non-exclusive, 
perpetual, irrevocable, sublicensable, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid-up and transferable license, under your 
intellectual property rights, to publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce, use, make, have made, sell, offer for 
sale, distribute (through multiple tiers of distribution), import, create derivative works of and otherwise
